  coreValueLong:
    "Alloqly is a privacy-first AI platform that helps school districts like MCPS deliver truly tailored learning-without adding work to teachers' plates. Connected to Canvas, Alloqly reads the assignment, understands each student's IEP/504 accommodations (extra time, chunking, simplified vocabulary, alternative formats, read-aloud, etc.), and auto-generates adapted versions in minutes. Teachers keep full control-approve, edit, or assign with one click-while Alloqly handles OCR of worksheets, accessibility checks, and quick rubrics. No sensitive student data is stored beyond what's required for delivery; we're built with FERPA in mind and support in-district or restricted cloud processing. The result: higher engagement for neurodivergent and accommodated learners, faster feedback loops, and measurable time saved per class. Start with a small pilot, compare outcomes against your current workflow, and scale what works-so every student gets what they need, and every teacher gets time back.",
